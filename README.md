# stock_analysis
Week 2 VBA
Written Analysis of Results

Overview of Project: The purpose of this analysis is to show a thorough analysis of VBA including creating for loops, conditional formatting, and repurposing code previously used to quicken the process of the stock analysis.

Analysis: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, and the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Results: In a summary statement address the following:

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The advantage of repurposing code can be to simplify or save time on the code you are creating, but it can also be your downfall. All it takes is a slip of a key or an editing error, and it can be ver cumbersome to find the error made. That is what happened to me. I also didn't indent correctly and continued to receive a run time error.
